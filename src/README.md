## Overview

The purpose of this app is to  build a server on port 7000 using express. The app takes input sends request to the server to return the output which is an object Box that contains firstName, lastName, address and date. The server will show the result taken from the faker = the random result from fake data to test it. The app also provides an option to pull an object by id and display it, update the value or erase it.

2. Build a Box model in box.js.
3. Build a server and add start and stop routes.
4. Create initial test for server.
5. Write logger.js file.
6. Create error-middleware.js and error-middleware.js to handle errors.
7. Make sure server listens on port 7000 in .env file. Write test for .env.
8. Add the line db/ to .gitignore.
9. Create box-router.js and test file. We need to include POST, GET, PUT and DELETE.
